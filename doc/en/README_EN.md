  This project is the brainchild of a non-computer professional.

  It is a mix of third-party projects, beginners messy style code, and may have all kinds of bugs
  
  PC assistant for handheld game LimbusCompany.
  
  This project is based on image recognition and text recognition, one-click liver protection 

  reused a lot of other people's code ~~including this README~~

## How to download

Click [Realeases](https://github.com/KIYI671/AhabAssistantLimbusCompany/releases) and download the file called AALC-vx.x.x in the latest version, unzip it and run AALC.exe.

I don't have much technical power, but I also messed up the GUI and used the third-party OCR, so the file is relatively large!

## Instructions for use

### A maneuver that even Don Quixote could learn ###

</details>


During script execution you can use **CTRL+Q** keys to terminate the script process (this may cause problems when the script is restarted, which can be solved by restarting the script program).

There is nothing to explain, what you see is what you get.

If you find any problems (except for the team numbering problem below), you can report them to [Issue](https://github.com/KIYI671/AhabAssistantLimbusCompany/issues).

Of course, you are also welcome to submit [Pull Request](https://github.com/KIYI671/AhabAssistantLimbusCompany/pulls)

### Theme package blacklist settings

Please download the zip file, there is a file **_“black_list_keyword.yaml”_** in the unzipped file.
When you open it with Notepad or other text editors, you can add the blacklist by following its format.


The file format is shown in the following picture.

### Running in the background

- This language is not currently supported in this section of the related materials.
- **Need to run in the background or have multiple monitors try [Remote Local Multi-User Desktop](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv24286313/)**
- **All related files in the above tutorials: [download link](https://github.com/CHNZYX/asu_version_latest/releases)**
- **Related files can also be obtained by going to the tutorial author's [Home - Dynamic Page](https://space.bilibili.com/26715033/dynamic) from the top**.
- Emulators have many drawbacks such as lagging and high performance consumption.
- It is recommended that you use the Windows Remote Desktop Service for this program.
- The performance consumption of running the program directly on your computer is less than that of an emulator.

## Attention!!!

- **This project only supports the use of English (EN) as the language of the game**
- Temporarily can only use 1920 * 1080 window to run, not tested screen less than or equal to 1920 * 1080, also not recommended in less than the resolution of the use!
- There may be a variety of strange bugs

## Acknowledgements

### Individual acknowledgements

The AALC project could not have been possible without the help of the following open source projects

|projects |links | introduction |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| LALC | [LixAssistantLimbusCompany](https://github.com/HSLix/LixAssistantLimbusCompany) | Thanks to the big guy's open source, so I can learn and start my own project by rewriting the big guy's project with step-by-step follow-up |
| OCR Text Recognition | [PaddleOCR-json](https://github.com/hiroi-sora/PaddleOCR-json) | Without it there would be no auto-recognition of teams, auto-recognition of Mirror Jail theme packs |
| Graphical Interface Component Library | [PyQt-Fluent-Widgets](https://github.com/zhiyiYo/PyQt-Fluent-Widgets) | Although only used the basic components, not much development potential, but the basic components have made the GUI aesthetics UP |
|March7thAssistant| [March7thAssistant](https://github.com/moesnow/March7thAssistant) | Learned quite a bit from the big guy here (~~ next full project teardown prep~~) |


### Uniform acknowledgements

## At last

If you found the software helpful, please click Star.

I hope some bigwig will give a wave of pointers or optimization to this beginner style mess of code!

Hopefully this software will help people reduce the repetitive and tedious parts of limbus playthroughs and enjoy the wonderful plot, performances, and mechanics inside!
