## How to download

Click [Realeases](https://github.com/KIYI671/AhabAssistantLimbusCompany/releases) and download the file called AALC-vx.x.x in the latest version, unzip it and run AALC.exe.

I don't have much technical power, but I also built a GUI and used the third-party OCR, so the file is relatively large!

## Instructions for use

### A maneuver that even Don Quixote could learn ###

<details>
<summary>click me ！！！</summary>
<img src="/assets/doc/image/how_to_use.png"/> 



</details>


During script execution you can use **CTRL+Q** keys to terminate the script process (this may cause problems when the script is restarted, which can be solved by restarting the script program).

At the same time **ALT+P** can pause the script, **ALT+R** can resume the script (experimental function)

There is nothing to explain, what you see is what you get.

If you find any problems (except for the team numbering problem below), you can report them to [Issue](https://github.com/KIYI671/AhabAssistantLimbusCompany/issues).

Of course, you are also welcome to submit [Pull Request](https://github.com/KIYI671/AhabAssistantLimbusCompany/pulls)

### Theme package blacklist settings

Please download the zip file, there is a file **_“black_list_keyword.yaml”_** in the unzipped file.
When you open it with Notepad or other text editors, you can add the blacklist by following its format.


The file format is shown in the following picture.

### Running in the background

- This language is not currently supported in this section of the related materials.
- **Need to run in the background or have multiple monitors try [Remote Local Multi-User Desktop](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv24286313/)**
- **All related files in the above tutorials: [download link](https://github.com/CHNZYX/asu_version_latest/releases)**
- **Related files can also be obtained by going to the tutorial author's [Home - Dynamic Page](https://space.bilibili.com/26715033/dynamic) from the top**.
- Emulators have many drawbacks such as lagging and high performance consumption.
- It is recommended that you use the Windows Remote Desktop Service for this program.
- The performance consumption of running the program directly on your computer is less than that of an emulator.

## Attention!!!

- **_This project already supports English (EN) and Simplified Chinese (zh_cn) as the in-game language_**
- Currently, we only recommend running it at resolutions of 1920 * 1080 and 2160 * 1440. We have not tested screens smaller than 1920 * 1080, and we do not recommend using it at resolutions smaller than that!
- If you have enabled the performance display function of steam or other software, you should try to avoid covering the game screen, otherwise it may cause problems in the script usage process.
- There may be a variety of strange bugs

## At last

If you found the software helpful, please click Star.

I hope some bigwig will give a wave of pointers or optimization to this beginner style mess of code!

Hopefully this software will help people reduce the repetitive and tedious parts of limbus playthroughs and enjoy the wonderful plot, performances, and mechanics inside!
